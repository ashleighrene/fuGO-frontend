### Your project idea 
fuGO:  A Food Ordering App for a Sushi Restaurant
-The site will eventually allow the user the ability to add food to the cart and checkout.  I wanted to expand on a project similar to  my Storefront site while incorporating backend, auth, and payment.

### Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
Front -  React , CSS, Bootstrap, Animate.css
###
Back - Express / Mongoose
Database - MongoDB

### List of backend models and their properties (created but not in first deployment)
Order:  customer_name, address, total, status, payment_method
Product: title, description, image, price, options

### React component hierarchy (if applicable)

### User stories
As a user, I would like to be able to view all of the items(products) available to order with picture, description and price.
As a user, I would like to view contact information for the restaurant as well as some additions that give it more character (events).

### Post MVP
As a user, I would like to add items(products) to my cart and checkout.

### Extra Notes
I will be incorporating animate.css for something new along with some Bootstrap.
Post MVP, I will be learning some kind of payment process either with Stripe or PayPal
